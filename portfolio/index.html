    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a passionate web developer with an interest for creating enjoyable user experiences. 
        My journey in coding began in high school and has 
        since turned into, hopefully, a full-time career, where I get to solve puzzles every day and 
        bring visions to life.
    </p>
    <p>
        Outside of coding, I enjoy soccer, outdoors, and exploring the world. 
        I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to grow. So, let's connect 
        if you have an exciting project in mind or simply want to get to know me better!

            <h3>High School</h3>
            <p>I loved coding simple projects ever since I took AP Computer Science in my senior year.
                I didn't take it as seriously as I should have, but this was just the start.

            <h3>College</h3>
            <p>During college, I've learned more than I could have imagined! I did not know the plethora of 
                knowledge that was available to me in the Computer Science world!
